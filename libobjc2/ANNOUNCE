GNUstep Objective-C Runtime 1.8
===============================

This is a point release to the ninth official release of the GNUstep
Objective-C runtime (a.k.a.  libobjc2).  This runtime was designed to support
the features of modern dialects of Objective-C for use with GNUstep and other
Objective-C programs.  Highlights of this release include:

- Added API for tracing, allowing interposition on all message sends matching a
  given selector.

You may obtain the code for this release from subversion at the following
subversion branch:

The runtime library is responsible for implementing the core features of the
object model, as well as exposing introspection features to the user.  The
GNUstep runtime implements Apple's Objective-C Runtime APIs, and a small number
of GCC APIs for legacy compatibility.

This library is based on the Étoilé Objective-C Runtime, an earlier research
prototype, and includes support for non-fragile instance variables,
type-dependent dispatch, and object planes.  It is fully backwards compatible
with the FSF's GCC 4.2.1 Objective-C ABI and also implements a new ABI that is
supported by Clang and Étoilé's LanguageKit and is required for some of the
newer features.

mailing list <gnustep-dev@gnu.org>.
