Subjective
==========

Subjective is a Windows/MinGW32 port of the Objective-C 2.0 run-time environment; it uses the LLVM/clang compiler which means you can use all the latest features of the Objective-C language on Windows. It doesn't, however, provide the GUI layer. Subjective is based on the GNUstep libobjc2 and GNUstep Base modules.
