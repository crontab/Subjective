Subjective
==========

Subjective is a Windows/MinGW32 port of the Objective-C 2.0 run-time environment. It allows you to use the LLVM/clang compiler and enjoy most of the latest features of the Objective-C language on Windows. It doesn't, however, provide the GUI layer.

Subjective is based on GNUstep libobjc2 and GNUstep Base. These submodules are slightly modified forks of their respective source bases. Among other things, simple plain Makefiles have been added that work under MinGW32 and have minimal dependencies.

Instructions on building the modules will be posted here soon. Additional libraries required for deployment of your app will be provided separately in binary form, outside of this repository.

#####This is a work in progress. Please, be *impatient*, contribute!
